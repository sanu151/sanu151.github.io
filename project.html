                        <p>
                            This project is a collection of implementations and examples of various data structures and
                            algorithms. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in
                            computer
                            science.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>About</h5>
                        <p>The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive reference for commonly used data
                            structures
                            and algorithms. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks,
                            queues,
                            trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.</p>
                        <p>Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a programming language, accompanied by
                            detailed
                            explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and example use cases. The code is
                            organized
                            into
                            separate modules, making it easy to navigate and understand.</p>
                        <p>This project is intended for both beginners and experienced programmers who want to enhance
                            their
                            understanding of data structures and algorithms. It can be used as a study guide, a
                            reference
                            for
                            coding interviews, or a starting point for building more complex applications.</p>

                        <p>This project is a login page implementation built using Django, a Python web framework, and
                            SQLite, a
                            lightweight relational database. It provides a secure and seamless login experience for
                            users
                            and

                        <h5>About</h5>
                        <p>The login page project leverages the power of Django and SQLite to handle user authentication
                            and
                            store user data securely. It demonstrates the usage of Django's built-in authentication
                            system,
                            including user registration, login, password reset, and session management.</p>
                        <p>SQLite, a serverless and file-based database, is used as the underlying database for storing
                            user
                            information. It provides a simple and efficient solution for development purposes, making it
                            easy to
                            get started with the project.</p>
